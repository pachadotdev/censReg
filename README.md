The goal of this repository is to keep a copy of the censReg package for Censored Regression (Tobit) Models. This is not mine, except for some modifications. The original package is available on CRAN and was made by Arne Henningsen.

## Installation

You can install the development version of censReg from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pachadotdev/censReg")
```
